# Image Processing Project

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project is implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebook and can be run on Google Colab for easy access and execution.

## Description

This project covers several fundamental and advanced image processing techniques using CNNs. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide to image processing with practical examples and detailed explanations.

### Features
- Image Preprocessing
- Data Augmentation
- Building and Training CNN Models
- Image Classification
- Visualization of Results

## Installation

To run this project locally, you will need to install the required libraries. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can open the notebook in Google Colab, which provides a ready-to-use environment.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook image_processing_mini.ipynb
    ```
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell and observe the results.

## Examples

The notebook includes several examples illustrating different image processing techniques, such as:
- Loading and Preprocessing Images
- Building a Simple CNN Model
- Training the Model on a Dataset
- Evaluating Model Performance
- Visualizing Predictions
