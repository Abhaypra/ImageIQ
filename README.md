# 🧠 Image IQ


---

## 🔍 Overview

**Image IQ** explores the power of **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image detection and classification. Designed as an educational walkthrough, it provides both **beginners and intermediate learners** a practical understanding of core image processing techniques using deep learning. The entire implementation is done using **Python** in a **Jupyter Notebook**, and is fully compatible with **Google Colab**.

## 🎯 Key Features

* 🧹 **Image Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and prepare image data
* 🔄 **Data Augmentation:** Increase training data variability to reduce overfitting
* 🧱 **CNN Architecture:** Build custom deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras
* 🧠 **Image Classification:** Train and evaluate models on labeled datasets
* 📈 **Visualization:** See training progress and predictions in real time
