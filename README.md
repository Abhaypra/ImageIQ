Detect the image using CNN use mobile_net

Project Name: OpenCV Object Detection with SSD MobileNet v2

Description:

This project implements object detection using the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) MobileNet v2 model from TensorFlow. It enables you to identify various objects within images based on the COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context).

Features:

Object Detection: Accurately detect a wide range of objects (people, vehicles, animals, everyday items) in images.
Pre-trained Model: Leverages the well-trained SSD MobileNet v2 model for efficient object classification.
Visual Output: Displays detected objects with bounding boxes and class labels overlaid on the image for clear visualization.
Code Clarity: Well-structured and commented code promotes understanding and maintainability.
Requirements:

Python 3 (tested version)
OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
Matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)
TensorFlow (tested with a compatible version)
Pillow (PIL Fork) (pip install Pillow)
Installation:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/opencv-object-detection.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd opencv-object-detection
Create a virtual environment (recommended): python -m venv venv and activate it using source venv/bin/activate (Windows) or venv/bin/activate (Linux/macOS).
Install required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt (assuming a requirements.txt file is present with all dependencies listed).
Download assets (optional): If you don't have the pre-trained model and class labels, uncomment the download and extraction logic in the code. This requires an internet connection.
Usage:

Run the script: python object_detection.py
Upload images: Use the provided Google Colab notebook cell (if applicable) or adapt the code for local image processing.
View results: Detected objects will be displayed with bounding boxes and class labels overlaid on the image.
